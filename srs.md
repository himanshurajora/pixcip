# Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for PixelCipher

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose  
The purpose of the PixelCipher web application is to provide a platform where users can input an image and a secret key string. The app will apply a specific hash function to convert the secret key string into a number and use that number to manipulate the pixel colors in the image. The changes to the image are reversible, meaning the original image can be restored using the same secret key.

### 1.2 Scope  
PixelCipher is a web-based tool that allows users to interact with images and secret keys. It performs pixel-based transformations, where the color values of pixels are altered by applying a hash function to a user-defined secret key. The tool should be lightweight, intuitive, and responsive.

### 1.3 Definitions and Acronyms
- **Hash Function**: A function that converts the input (secret key string) into a fixed-size number, which will be used to manipulate the image pixels.
- **Pixel Manipulation**: Adjusting the color values of individual pixels based on the generated number from the hash function.
- **Reversible Transformation**: The process that allows the image to be restored to its original form using the same secret key.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
- The app will be a client-side solution built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to run directly in web browsers without any need for additional installations.
- Users will upload an image, provide a secret key, and the app will hash the key and adjust the image pixels accordingly. The user will be able to reverse the operation by entering the same secret key.

### 2.2 Product Features
- **Image Upload**: The user can upload a custom image (JPEG, PNG, etc.).
- **Secret Key Input**: Users will input a secret key string that is used to generate a hash.
- **Hash Function**: A JavaScript-based hash function that transforms the secret key string into a unique number.
- **Pixel Color Manipulation**: The app will alter the colors of each pixel based on the generated hash number.
- **Reversible Process**: The user can revert the color changes back to the original image by providing the same secret key.
- **Download Option**: Users will be able to download the transformed or original image after processing.

### 2.3 User Characteristics
- The users of this app are expected to be general internet users who may or may not have a background in coding or image manipulation.
- The app will be designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind, offering an intuitive interface for uploading images and entering secret keys.

## 3. System Features

### 3.1 Image Upload and Display
- **Description**: Users will upload an image file (JPG, PNG, GIF, etc.), and it will be displayed in the app interface.
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - Users must be able to upload image files.
  - The uploaded image will be displayed within the browser.

### 3.2 Secret Key Input
- **Description**: The user will input a secret key string that will be used to generate a unique hash number for pixel manipulation.
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - Users will input a string in a text field.
  - The secret key will be hashed into a number using a hashing algorithm (e.g., SHA-256 or MD5).

### 3.3 Hashing Algorithm
- **Description**: The secret key input by the user will be processed by a hashing function to generate a unique number.
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - The hash function will take the input string and convert it into a number.
  - The same string must always generate the same number.
  - The hash function must be implemented entirely on the client-side using JavaScript.

### 3.4 Pixel Color Manipulation
- **Description**: Based on the generated number from the hash function, the app will modify the RGB values of each pixel in the image.
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - The app will adjust the RGB color values by a determined method (e.g., adding, subtracting, or multiplying the color values by the hash number modulo 256).
  - Each pixelâ€™s color will be altered to create a modified version of the image.

### 3.5 Revert to Original
- **Description**: The user can reverse the color changes made to the image by entering the same secret key.
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - When the same secret key is input, the image will return to its original color values.
  - The process should be deterministic and always produce the same output for the same input.

### 3.6 Download Option
- **Description**: After transforming or reverting the image, the user can download the resulting image.
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - The user should be able to download the modified or original image.
  - The image should be downloadable in a standard format (e.g., PNG, JPG).

## 4. External Interface Requirements

### 4.1 User Interface
The user interface will consist of:
  - A file input button for image upload.
  - A text field for entering the secret key.
  - A button to trigger the transformation and apply the changes to the image.
  - A button to trigger the revert action to restore the image to its original form.
  - A download button for saving the modified image.

### 4.2 Hardware Interfaces
- The app will be designed to run on typical desktop or mobile devices with modern web browsers.

### 4.3 Software Interfaces
- The app will run on all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.).
- The app will be built using standard web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 5. System Design Constraints

### 5.1 Platform Constraints
- The app will be built for browsers and will rely on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring compatibility with all modern web browsers.

### 5.2 Performance Constraints
- The app should process small to medium-sized images efficiently, with minimal delay for both the color manipulation and revert operations.

### 5.3 Security Constraints
- The system will not store any user data or images on the server; all operations will be performed client-side.
- No personal data will be collected.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

### 6.1 Usability
- The application should be easy to navigate, with clear instructions for each step (upload, input secret key, process image, revert, and download).

### 6.2 Reliability
- The application must consistently provide the correct image transformation based on the input secret key and hash function.

### 6.3 Portability
- The app must function across all modern browsers on desktop and mobile devices.

### 6.4 Maintainability
- The app should be modular and easy to update if necessary, especially with regard to hashing algorithms or UI improvements.

## 7. Appendix

### 7.1 Glossary
- **Pixel**: A single point in an image, represented by its RGB values.
- **Hash**: A number generated from an input string (secret key) using a hash function.
